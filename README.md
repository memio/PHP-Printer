# PHP Printer

PHP Printer aims at providing a Pretty Printer powered by a templating engine,
for [PHP Parser](https://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser).

If you're not familiar with it, PHP Parser is a fantasic library that provides:

* an [Abstract Syntax Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree)
  (AST), allowing you to describe PHP code programatically
* a Parser that reads actual PHP code and builds an AST out of it
* a Pretty Printer that can convert the AST back to actual PHP code

Unfortunately, the code generated by its Pretty Printer can only be customized
by extending the `PhpParser\PrettyPrinter\Standard` class
(see [this PSR-2 example](https://github.com/tcopestake/PHP-Parser-PSR-2-pretty-printer)).

Using a template engine, those coding style can be more easily customized: all
we'd need is to create a template, and use it to overwrite the default one.

## Roadmap

PHP Printer just started, so there's nothing available yet. Here's the roadmap:

* [ ] Create a Templating Engine
      (an interface to allow third party implementations such as
      [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/),
      and a simple implementation since one of the drawback of Memio seemed to
      have been [its usage of Twig](https://github.com/memio/memio/issues/51))
* [ ] Create a Pretty Printer
      (based on the strategy pattern to allow extension points,
      and a start a templates: classes, interfaces, properties and method
      signatures. See [Simpla RFC](https://github.com/memio/PHP-Printer/issues/1))

We're going to use our experience with [Memio](http://memio.github.io/memio/)
to make PHP Printer the right tool for PHP code generation! At least that's
what we aim for.
